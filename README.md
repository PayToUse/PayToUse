## Introduction

Hi! I'm Louie, and I'm a content creator, a html programmer, a resource and behavior pack coder for Minecraft Bedrock.

My journey to having this life was successful. It all started back in April 2020, where i started my journey to being YouTube's future content creator

While my YouTube channel is alive, until in October 2021, i gained a huge boost of subscribers, from 217 to 2.71k. As of right now, my channel started dying, from a huge boost of views to a little amount of views

At November 2021, i started practicing about coding, which inspired me by a bunch of coders from YouTube.

More stories soon. I'm running out of time.
