This handbook gives you the ability to learn and know anything about C++

## What is C++?
C++ is a high-level, a general-purpose and a cross-platform programming language used to make high-performance applications for Microsoft Windows. It is also one of the world's most popular programming languages.

This programming language is developed by a danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, which makes "C" succeeded by this programming language

## Similarities and Differences
According to W3Schools, the main similarities and differences between C and C++ are:

The difference is that C++ supports modules, classes and objects, while C does not mainly support them. C++ has more complex syntaxes with modules, which gives more functionality to the program.

The similarity is that C and C++ has and uses "almost" the same syntax.

## Further Information
According to Wikipedia, C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).

C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

According to TechTarget, C++ allows software developers to define their own data types and manipulate them using functions and methods. It also allows low-level programming and provides access to memory, enabling fast and efficient execution of code. It also supports generic programming using templates, which let code be written in a generic form and reused for different data types.

C++ is used in fields such as system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance applications. The C++ standard library provides a range of coding utilities and functions, making it easy to develop complex software systems. C++ can run on many platforms, including Linux, Mac and Windows.

## C++ Sample Code
This is the sample code for you to get started with, you can copy all of this content to your program.

In a new program, beginners must include the `#include <iostream>` in the first line or else it won't work.
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  
  return 0;
}
```

If you want to experiment with basic math, here's another one:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 6;
  int sum = x + y;
  cout << sum;
  return 0;
}
```

## Why do backend programmers recommend you to learn C++?
According to GeeksForGeeks:
- C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.
- C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.
- It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs and providing security.
- It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is easy to learn so that you can choose it as your first programming language.
- It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#

## C++ Examples
The most popular games that use C++ is Minecraft (Bedrock Edition), made by Notch (Markus Persson), and World of Warcraft, made by the Blizzard Entertainment (Allen Adham, Michael Morhaime, and Frank Pearce).
